        <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for 
        the Internet or an intranet. Web development can range from
        developing a simple single static page of plain text to 
        complex web-based internet applications, 
        electronic businesses, and social network services</p>

    <h3>HTML5</h3>
    <p>Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.

    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.</p>

    <img src="img/javascript.png", width="130", height="70" alt="">
    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.</p>

    <h3>Node.js</h3>
    <p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser</p>

    <h3>Python</h3>
    <p>Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="img/php.png", width="100" alt="">
    <h3>PHP</h3>
    <p>PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994; the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.</p>
